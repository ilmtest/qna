# IlmTest Questions Forums

[Tutorial video on how to submit questions](https://youtu.be/MYQYVoQZ7P4)

Welcome to the `IlmTest Q&A Portal` where you can submit questions to the members of the IlmTest project.

Please observe the following etiquettes when asking questions.

1. This is `NOT` a forum to ask for `fatāwá`! Masāʿil that require fatāwá (ie: issues of divorce, issues of fitan that affect the Ummah, etc.) are reserved and should be posed to `Ahl al-ʿilm` (ie: scholars), and should not be posed to students of knowledge, nor in a forum such as this.

2. The main purpose of this forum is for research. The members of the `IlmTest` project will not answer any of these questions themselves, but rather they will do research to seek out existing scholarly fatāwá that have already been issued on that question, and link it as the answer. The expectation is that there should be absolutely no words (other than minor clarifications of ambiguous wording that may appear in brackets) by the project members.

3. This is a *PUBLIC* forum, and thus all the questions posed are visible to everyone. At this time we are not accepting any `private` questions. As a result please be careful to choose your words carefully on questions that may be sensitive in nature. You may also consider using a kunyah instead of your real name on [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/profile) to preserve your identity when asking such questions.

4. No questions pertaining to `marital` problems, or personal disputes should be posed here, because such issues require mediation and that both sides be heard. Any such questions (ie: `marriage`-related) should be posed in a general manner, such that a general answer may be provided. However it should be understood that applying this general answer to a specific situation is not always valid.

5. Remember to be as detailed as possible with the questions. Ambiguous or vague questions will not be answered until they are clarified with detail.

6. Absolutely no questions will be tolerated pertaining to fitnah between students of knowledge, or scholars. These have a place in the religion, and they are to be posed to the major scholars, and not on forums like these.

7. For absolutely urgent questions, please make a note of it in the `Issue` title or description.

8. This is also your opportunity to send feedback, suggestions, and corrections to the team on anything published by IlmTest.

9. The project member who is doing the research will do a best-effort in providing an answer to the question. It is by no means the only answer, and also there may be other valid opinions out there that were not mentioned. This will be at the discretion of the project member, and the questioner should always consider that more research may result in other opinions.

10. Violations of any of the rules and etiquettes will result in the question being rejected. Note that this is not a forum for idle talk, but rather it serves a very specific purpose. Misuse of it will cause in consequences such as warnings, and then subsequent banning.

## Methodology

- Every month a group of the questions that were posed will be collected into a `Milestone`.
- These questions will be moved into the `In Progress` project status to let the questioner know that they are being investigated.
- Once the investigation is complete, the research conclusion will be posed in one of the `IlmTest` social media channels, and a link to it will be pasted in the question `Issue`, and subsequently closed.
